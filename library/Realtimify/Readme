How to compile the example:
 - Adapt the Makefile to your needs. You will at least have to change 
   SYSTEMC according to your SystemC installation.   
 - Compile the application by executing "make".
 - Execute the example by executing "./program".

How to use Realtimify in your application:
 - Copy realtimify.h and realtimify.cpp into the source tree of your 
   application.
 - Handle the Realtimify module in your Makefile just like your other 
   modules are handled there.
 - Alternatively, you might also generate a static or dynamic library.
 - Include "realtimify.h" in your top-level file and instantiate a 
   Realtimify module in a similar fashion as you can find in the example
   provided herein (main.cpp).

More information:
 There is a paper available called 
 "Realtimify - A small Tool for Real Time SystemC Simulations".
 It can be downloaded from http://www.digital-force.net/publications/
 and discusses some details of Realtimify.

Have fun!
