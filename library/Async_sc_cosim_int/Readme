This class provides a module that implements an asynchronous
channel interface which can support 3 different ways to transfer data from the Operationg system to a SystemC Module
This interfaces can be used by a systemC model of a device to be accessed by a real operating system.
The two ways to read data from  the operation system and back is by using share memory (system V or posix) and the other is by tcp sockets

The communication between the to worlds is done by using 2 methods. One os thread method called async_os_thread and one systemC thread method called system asysc_sysc_thread_process.
These methods are references as os_thread and sysc_thread respectively in our paper.
The role of these threads is to be used to pass data between the operating system (host) and the systemC based device (DuT)

More about this can be found in our paper under the doc folder

A regression test is also provided to display the functionality of the interface on a simple Memory Like Device.
