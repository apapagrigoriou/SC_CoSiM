This is a regression test that helps understand the functionality
of the generic asynchronous channel interface, with POSIX, SystemV
or TCP, and optionally Realtimefy support

To run the test:

1) Run first async_module.exe
2) Run testbench.exe

and observe the fow of information from systemc application via the
channel to a thread listening on the other side of the channel.

Problems?

I get ...
Warning: MAIN: Caught exception Error: LISTENER: ALERT: Out of Bound Address request : 0x
Is this expected, after first packet???
