# SC_CoSiM

SC_CoSiM is a platform which focuses on validating a full system, by performing near real-time, command-to-command co-simulation of the hardware DUT implemented on FPGA as a full system prototype (with CPU, on-chip interconnect, memory, application, drivers, and OS, typically Linux) against its equivalent cycle-approximate system-level model of the DUT.
Our work presented at DVCon-Europe 2018 extended the technology demonstrator from David C Black(https://github.com/dcblack/technology_demonstrator).
